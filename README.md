# Clinic_Data_Shiny_App
This dashboard is based on a synthetic clinical data set and does not provide any deeper insights. It should mainly show various applications of interactive content and allow the user to 1. filter the underlying data and 2. change the fundamentals of the diagrams by editing their x-axis.

You may find the dashboard published via shinyapp.io under the following link
